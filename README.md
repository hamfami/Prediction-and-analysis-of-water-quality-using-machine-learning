# Prediction-and-analysis-of-water-quality-using-machine-learning

The dataset used is from kaggle website : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utcarshagrawal/water-quality-data by UTCARSH AGRAWAL

first, i do the clustering method to make 2 cluster from the dataset either safe or dangerous water.

Then, i do prediction using random forest, decision tree and svm to analyse which method is the best to use in real time.
