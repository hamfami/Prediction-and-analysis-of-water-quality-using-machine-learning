# Prediction-and-analysis-of-water-quality-using-machine-learning

- The dataset used is from kaggle website : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utcarshagrawal/water-quality-data by UTCARSH AGRAWAL

## Overview
- This research focuses on the prediction and analysis of water quality using machine learning techniques. The main objectives include establishing machine learning models such as the Decision Tree Method, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest Method for real-time water quality prediction, and analyze the performance of all the machine learning models by calculating the accuracy. 

- A user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) is also developed for convenient input of new data. 

- By analyzing the performance of these models and providing real-time predictions, this study contributes to effective water resource management. The models are trained and evaluated using a comprehensive dataset of water quality parameters, enabling accurate predictions and insights into water quality trends. The GUI enhances usability by allowing users to easily input new data and obtain instant predictions, facilitating informed decision-making in water quality management and planning.

## Dataset
- In the first phase of the study,the dataset was prepared specifically for the research purposes and was obtained from a public online database which is Kaggle. The dataset is called "waterquality.csv" by Utcarsh Agrawal. 

### Dataset Preparation 
- Data preprocessing, a crucial phase in the data mining process that entails removing or altering data before it is utilised to guarantee or improve performance. "Garbage in, garbage out" is especially true for data mining and machine learning
initiatives. Inadequate oversight during data collection can lead to errors such as outof-range values (such as Income = -100) or implausible data combinations (such as Sex = Male and Pregnant = Yes).

- Data Cleaning is a crucial aspect of any machine learning process. It’s a crucial aspect of making any kind of model work. It’s not the most glamorous aspect of ML, and there aren’t any esoteric techniques to learn. However, data cleansing can makeor break a project. Since "Better data beats fancier algorithms," this is where most professional data scientists put forth the most effort. 

- The dataset was divided into two subsets: the training dataset and test dataset, using a 60:40 split.

## Clustering

The first step of the project involves clustering the dataset into two groups: safe water and dangerous water. This clustering helps in categorizing water samples based on their quality.

## Prediction Models
- Three machine learning models are used for prediction and analysis:
    - Random Forest
    - Decision Tree
    - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- These models are trained on the dataset to predict water quality in real-time.
